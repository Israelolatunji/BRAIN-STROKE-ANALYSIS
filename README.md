### **Dataset Shape**
```python
print("The number of rows:", df.shape[0])
print("The number of columns:", df.shape[1])

The number of columns is: 8

```

```python
### **Checking for missing values**
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()

# Print the missing values for each column
print(missing_values)

# Check if there are any missing values in the entire dataset
if missing_values.sum() == 0:
    print("No missing values in the dataset.")
else:
    print("There are missing values in the dataset.")

```

## **Model Building**  

### **Train-Test Split**
```python
X = df.drop(columns=['stroke'])
y = df['stroke']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### **Logistic Regression**
```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### **Model Evaluation**
```python
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## **Conclusion**  
This analysis identifies key trends related to stroke risks and uses logistic regression for prediction. Future work will focus on improving the model and exploring advanced algorithms.
