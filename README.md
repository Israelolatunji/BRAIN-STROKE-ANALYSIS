## **Overview**  
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.

Stroke occurs due to a decrease in oxygen to the brain. This can be due to a bleed or blockage in the brainâ€™s blood supply. Immediate emergency treatment may help prevent life threatening consequences.

This analysis examines key variables such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and lifestyle factors to identify trends and build a model for predicting stroke occurrence.

## **Model Building**  

### **Train-Test Split**
```python
X = df.drop(columns=['stroke'])
y = df['stroke']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### **Logistic Regression**
```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### **Model Evaluation**
```python
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## **Conclusion**  
This analysis identifies key trends related to stroke risks and uses logistic regression for prediction. Future work will focus on improving the model and exploring advanced algorithms.
